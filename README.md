# GROUP BUY

#### Video Demo: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnb59A2XoEk>

#### Inspiration:

It is inconvenient that people will encounter problems when shopping for a large number of items but they don’t actually need that amount. For example, when shopping at wholesale, the item usually includes the number for a family to use for weeks or months.

#### What it does:

We are creating an application that can help people find the items they would like to buy and share with other families or students, to save more money and make shopping more accessible. People tend to waste it or don’t know how to deal with the extra items that they don’t need. Our application can help people find the item that they need and share it with others who have the same need.

#### How we built it:

We created a web application by using React which is a JavaScript framework for building web apps, and we used express to build the backend side.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm install express --save
$ npm install --save mysql2
$ npm install http-errors
$ npm install axios

$ npx create-react-app my-app
```

## Preparation

```bash
$ nvm use 16.14.2
```

## Execution

Run the application with:

```
npm start
```

Then you can open http://localhost:XXXX to check the program.

Now we are ready to go!
